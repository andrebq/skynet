Each process in SkyNet receives its configuration from a centralized configuration repository (currently MongoDB - possibly pluggable in the future).  Configuration changes are pulled by each process periodically to receive notification of new nodes.

A typical transaction will come to an Initiator (via http for example) and be sent to a router that is providing the appropriate service to route that type of requests.  The Router checks its routes and calls the services listed in its route configuration for that Route type.  Routes also define whether a service can be called Asynchronously (fire and forget) or whether the router must wait for a response.  For each service listed in the route the Router calls the service passing in the request and response objects.  When all services are run, the router returns a response to the Initiator who is responsible for presenting the data to the remote client appropriately.  In our HTTP example, this could mean translating to data using an HTML template, or an XML/JSON template.
